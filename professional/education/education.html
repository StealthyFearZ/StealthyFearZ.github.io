						<li>Early year academics was mainly Design Technology. Furniture Project: Built convertible furniture that could be decomposed into individual stacks.</li>
						<li>Worked on a large-scale model for a school presentation. It had 3 forms:
							<ul>
								<li>A Bookshelf</li>
								<li>A Chair</li>
								<li>A Table</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>I used Fusion360, Adobe Illustrator, 3DWOX, and high-fidelity modeling processes in this project.</li>

					<img src = "/images/Boat.jpg" alt = "A picture of 3 students floating in our boat across a swimming pool.">
					<ol>
						<li>Later years involved more physics and engineering-based work. Boat Project: Built a life-size functioning boat that could handle the weight of 5 men.</li>
						<li>Learned more about the design-process. Used different tools such as:
							<ul>
								<li>Circular Saws and Oil Motor</li>
								<li>CNC Machines(I made files)</li>
								<li>Varnish Station</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Used physics to design optimal shape for speed and size, mainly done on Fusion360 using Stress and Strain tests.</li>

					<p><strong>BYJU's FutureSchool of Coding: Tutoring</strong>
						FutureSchool is an organization that teaches students in multiple disciplines of which Coding is one. They teach music,
						math, and english in addition to Programming. I was introduced to FutureSchool back in 2020 and have took these classes
						since. I have worked on over 100+ projects since the beginning and have matured on the fronts of App/Web Development and,
						my focus, Artificial Intelligence. The classes I took under the tutelage of BYJU's professors have led me to a path of
						independece in terms of my learning where I now actively pursue active learning in the form of projects and online courses.
						An example of this active learning is below.

					<p><strong>LeetCode and Cursa Courses: Online Courses</strong> 
						LeetCode has been a very important part of my coding journey, providing a platform to hone my problem-solving skills and
						strengthen my understanding of topics through application. I have actively engaged with the platform since 2023, 
						solving 50+ problems since that range from basic to advanced in Python and Javascript. LeetCode's challenges have 
						primarily prepared me for technical interviews as has become common today in most internship processes. 
						Alongside LeetCode, I have taken several courses on Cursa, which have deepened my knowledge in fields such as 
						algorithms, machine learning, and back-end development. These online courses and application practice have allowed me 
						to extend my learning beyond just traditional academics and college courses.
