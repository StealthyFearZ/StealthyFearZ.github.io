			<p>High School Work Experience:
At Seoul Foreign High School, I gained extensive experience in 3D and visual design, programming, and electronics through various projects and responsibilities. This work experience lasted over 2023 and 2024 June-August. I was frequently tasked with designing logos and working on the school website, which allowed me to develop proficiency in Adobe Illustrator and web development. Additionally, I designed curriculum for high school students and supervised courses for younger students, giving me hands-on teaching experience. Through these roles, I also honed my skills in Fusion 360 for 3D modeling and expanded my programming knowledge. Although this work was unpaid, it provided me with valuable expertise in design software, instructional methods, and technical problem-solving.

			<p>Internship 1: Shree Girja Inter College- 
From June 2021 to August 2024, I worked as a paid intern at Shree Girja Sharan Inter College in Jaunpur, India, where I instructed underprivileged high school students asynchronously in the use of web browsers, extensions, and Windows OS software. This role required me to develop instructional materials and communicate complex technical concepts in an accessible manner. Through this experience, I strengthened my group management and effective communication skills while gaining valuable instructional expertise. Teaching students remotely also enhanced my ability to adapt to different learning styles and provide clear, structured guidance in a virtual setting.
