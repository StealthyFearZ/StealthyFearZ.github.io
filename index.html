			<div class="text-box">
				<p>Hello, My name is Daksh Raghuvanshi and I am a Freshman at University of Wisconsin Madison. I am currently 18 years old and am pursuing an education and, hopefully, career in Computer Science and Data Science.
					For me, there is nothing more mentally stimulating than the act of creation. I have slowly built up my skill in multiple forms of creative software such as Computer-Aided-Design, animation, sound design, and programming.
					My family’s support extended my interest in technology and encouraged my enrollment in multiple educational courses. My passion for Computer Science has and will always be centered on my single-minded focus on 
					the ability to realize ideas. For me, Computer Science is the art of taking one’s imaginative objectives and weaving them into existence using nothing but words on a screen. This area of study allows me to continuously 
					pursue my creative aspirations, offering endless opportunities for exploration, growth, and creation, especially with the implications of AI. In my free time, I enjoy simply relaxing with my friends or playing some form
					of sports. Recently, I have been getting into playing Volleyball, Pickelball, and even Weight Lifting. I plan on enjoying my college experience to the maximum so I have been training for multiple sports at the same time.

				<p>The purpose of this website is to display my current repertoire of skills, experience (both professional and personal), that I have managed to gain over the entirety of my education.
					I believe that I can use this website to display my skill as a programmer and as a student of many disciplines. I will be featuring multiple pages displaying anecdotes, awards, and
